## 👥 Project Context & Contributions
This project was a collaborative group effort for **ECS 171 (Machine Learning)**. We operated with a shared-ownership model where all members contributed to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and Flask integration.

* **Original Repository:** [(https://github.com/EddBr/ECS171-Final-Website)]
* **My Technical Focus:** I specifically headed the implementation and hyperparameter tuning of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier**. 
* **Collaborative Efforts:** I worked closely with the team on feature engineering and integrating the various trained models into the Flask backend.
* **Why this fork exists:** This fork serves as my personal portfolio version to demonstrate the end-to-end integration of our machine learning pipeline.
